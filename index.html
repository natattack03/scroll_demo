        <div class="title">What is March Madness?</div>
        March Madness is the colloquial name for the NCAA Division I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments. <br/><br/> This annual sports extravaganza captures the hearts of millions as 68 teams compete in a single-elimination format to win the national championship. <br/><br/> The drama, the suspense, and the sheer unpredictability make March Madness a highlight of the American sports calendar.

        There are over a <b style="color: #009CDE">1000</b> teams in the NCAA. Which teams get to play in March Madness?
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        Eligible teams are determined through <b style="color: #009CDE">bids</b>.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">What Are Bids?</div>
        Bids are invitations awarded to college basketball teams to participate in the March Madness tournament. There are two types of bids: <span class="automatic-bid">automatic</span> and <span class="at-large-bid">at-large</span>.
    </section>    
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Automatic Bids</div>
        These are given to 32 teams that win their respective conference tournaments. Each of the 32 NCAA Division I conferences holds a championship tournament at the end of the regular season, and the winner of each receives a guaranteed spot in March Madness.
    </section>    
        <section class="step">
        <div class="title">At-Large Bids</div>
        The NCAA Selection Committee, a group composed of conference commissioners and school athletic directors, awards at-large bids. <br/><br/>They select 36 teams that did not win their conference tournaments but are deemed worthy based on their overall season performance, strength of schedule, key wins, and other criteria. <br/><br/>This selection process happens on Selection Sunday, a day when the tournament bracket is revealed.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        With the bids determined, the next question is: <b style="color: #009CDE">How is the actual tournament structured?</b> <br/><br/>Transitioning from team selection to the heart of the competition, we now explore how the tournament is organized, setting the stage for a series of high-stakes rounds that captivate fans nationwide.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">What is a seed?</div>
        Each team is assigned a "seed" based on their expected performance, which is determined by their record during the regular season and other factors considered by the Selection Committee. 
      </section>
      <section>
        <section class="step">
        Seeds range from 1 to 16 in each of the four regions, with a seed of 1 being given to the teams deemed strongest. <br/><br/> This seeding helps to organize the tournament's matchups in a way that initially favors higher-seeded teams, theoretically allowing the best teams a better chance to progress in the competition.

        The tournament begins with the lowest-seeded teams (typically seeds 16 and some 11 or 12) competing to fill the final slots in the 64-team bracket. <br/><br/>  This is known as the <b style="color: #009CDE"> first four</b>.
